# 📝 Advanced To Do List 📝

My second JavaScript refreshment project – the more advanced to do list. This version offers additional functionalities like the ability to create separate task lists for better task management and the ability to mark the tasks as completed.

This app also uses local storage to store all added lists and tasks.

For this project I have also used Tailwind CSS along with custom CSS for nicer and refreshing design.
